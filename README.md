# 🏥 Hospital Patient Data Analysis (2025)

A comprehensive analysis of 1,000 hospital patient records conducted using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This project demonstrates core analytics skills relevant for Data Analyst internships, including data cleaning, EDA, visualizations, and performance insights.

---

## 📘 Project Objectives
- Analyze patient demographics and satisfaction
- Study monthly patient arrival trends
- Compare performance across services (ICU, Surgery, etc.)
- Evaluate variability and correlation across patient metrics
- Build feature engineering such as length of stay and satisfaction level

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Power BI Desktop

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation
- Converted date columns to datetime
- Added `length_of_stay` feature
- Classified satisfaction scores into:
  - Poor  
  - Average  
  - Good  
  - Excellent  

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Histograms for age, satisfaction, length of stay  
- Monthly patient arrival trends (bar + line charts)  
- Satisfaction by service (count plot)  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Service-wise variability (boxplot)  
- Service distribution (pie chart)  

---

## ⭐ Findings
- Monthly arrivals peak during **Aug–Oct**  
- **Emergency & Surgery** have the highest patient loads  
- Avg satisfaction = **79.6**, range 60–99  
- ICU & Emergency show high variability  
- Avg length of stay = **7.4 days**  

---

## 🎯 Recommendations
- Allocate more staff during peak months  
- Investigate variability in ICU/Emergency satisfaction  
- Improve wait-time management  
- Build ongoing dashboards for service monitoring
